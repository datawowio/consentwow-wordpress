# Development

WordPress Plugin use Subversion as VCS, so pushing codes to Git will not
directly update the plugin.

However, WordPress says [that](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/)
```
Warning:SVN and the Plugin Directory are a release repository. Unlike Git, you
shouldnâ€™t commit every small change, as doing so can degrade performance. Please
only push finished changes to your SVN repository.
```
Therefore, We will use Git for development and SVN for deployment.

## Folder Structure

The current version (and development version) of code should be inside /trunk
folder.

After finishing the new version, create a new tag by copy /trunk to
/tags/*version* and also create a tag via Git.

# Deployment

In order to deploy the new version, you should follow the
[instructions from WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/).

Please note that we [should not push any irrelevant code to SVN repo](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/#notes)
, e.g. .gitignore or README.md, so we need to ignore some files before commit
our code.

Therefore, we have create a text file "svnignore.txt" to store the filepaths we
want to ignore on SVN.

Run the command below before committing your code via SVN.
```
svn propset svn:ignore -F svnignore.txt .
```
